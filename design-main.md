# Design best practices
## Sketch
### Sketch and Abstract
Here at UX Cabin we use Sketch exclusively in conjunction with [Abstract](../version-main.md). This means you never open a file directly in Sketch, but rather create an appropriate branch in an Abstract project and continue from there.

### Pages
Asides from usual main pages, make sure to include the "ðŸ’€ Graveyard" page. Every design, idea, or inspiration you discard, simply move over to the ðŸ’€ Graveyard page.

### Symbols
Make sure to organize your symbols. 
### Artboards
### Grids
